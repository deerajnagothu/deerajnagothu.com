Hi there, Welcome to my Internet Homestead. :wave:

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department ([ECE](https://www.binghamton.edu/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html)) at Binghamton University advised by [Dr. Yu Chen](https://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~ychen/). I am a full-time Research Assistant and my current Doctoral Research focusses on Multimedia Authentication at Edge Devices using Environmental Fingerprints.

Other than Multimedia authentication, I have also contributed to Blockchain integration in Edge devices and Advanced Computer Vision applications in a secure surveillance system. Previously, I received my Master's degree in ECE from Binghamton University, where I submitted my thesis advised by [Dr. Andrey Dolgikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adolgikh/). From 2016-2020, I also instructed a Graduate class Network Computer Security on a virtual infrastructure developed by myself and Dr. Dolgikh.

As a researcher, I am deeply interested in all aspects of Information security and AI technology. This includes Multimedia authentication, Network security, Blockchain for IoT, and Smart Surveillance infrastructure. Recently, I have been interested in AI Safety and Alignment Research, and plan to continue my research in this direction.

Apart from my professional activities, I enjoy activities like Lifting and running. I am an avid [photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/deerajnagothu/) and mostly enjoy Landscape photography.

Feel free to reach out via email. :grin:
