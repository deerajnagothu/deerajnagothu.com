Hi there, Welcome to my Internet Homestead. :wave:

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department (ECE) at Binghamton University advised by Dr. Yu Chen. I am a full-time Research Assistant and my current Doctoral Research focusses on Multimedia Authentication at Edge Devices using Environmental Fingerprints. 

My current research leverages Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) from media recordings such as audio and video from smart surveillance networks and Edge devices. The ENF is used to authenticate media against visual layer attacks like frame duplication and DeepFake attacks. My research findings are available in my publications. Other than Multimedia authentication, I have also contributed to Blockchain integration in Edge devices and Advanced Computer Vision applications in a secure surveillance system. Previously, I received my Master's degree in ECE from Binghamton University, where I submitted my thesis advised by Dr. Andrey Dolgikh. From 2016-2020, I also instructed a Graduate class Network Computer Security on a virtual infrastructure developed by myself and Dr. Dolgikh. 

As a researcher, I am deeply interested in all aspects of Information security and AI technology. This includes Multimedia authentication, Network security, Blockchain for IoT, and Smart Surveillance infrastructure. Recently, I have been interested in AI Safety and Alignment Research, and plan to continue my research in this direction.

Apart from my professional activities, I enjoy activities like Lifting and running. I am an avid photographer and mostly enjoy Landscape photography. 

Feel free to reach out via email or a tweet :grin:.
