In addition, the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology allows customizing multimedia content to meet personal demands. However, the popularity of AI-based text-to-image generators like DeepAI also opens the door to generating images for social media platforms that impersonate unsuspecting users without their permission. While people enjoy high creativity, such “fake” images could enable the propagation of deceptive information that negatively impacts an individual’s personal life and potentially cause public unrest. Therefore, reliable methods to facilitate image authentication are vital to identify and flag them. In this paper, we present AUSOME-2, an upgraded version of our system that AUthenticates SOcial MEdia images (AUSOME) using frequency analysis technologies and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Images from several text-to-image platforms, such as Dall-E 2 and Google Deep Dream, are distinguished from genuine images. Spectral analysis techniques are used to obtain features and fingerprints in the frequency domain. These features enable the ML model to classify AI -generated social media images from genuine ones. The experimental results, on top of a proof-of-concept prototype, showed that the AUSOME-2 system is a promising approach to authenticate images with decent detection accuracy.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">MDPI</abbr> </div> <div id="qu2024MicroverseTaskOriented" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Microverse: A Task-Oriented Edge-Scale Metaverse</div> <div class="author"> Qian Qu , Mohsen Hatami , Ronghua Xu , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 6 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '6 more authors' ?

As society begins to harness the full potential of these smart environments, the horizon brightens with the promise of an immersive, interconnected 3D world. The forthcoming paradigm shift in how we live, work, and interact owes much to groundbreaking innovations in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR), blockchain, and digital twins (DTs). However, realizing the expansive digital vista in our daily lives is challenging. Current limitations include an incomplete integration of pivotal techniques, daunting bandwidth requirements, and the critical need for near-instantaneous data transmission, all impeding the digital VR metaverse from fully manifesting as envisioned by its proponents. This paper seeks to delve deeply into the intricacies of the immersive, interconnected 3D realm, particularly in applications demanding high levels of intelligence. Specifically, this paper introduces the microverse, a task-oriented, edge-scale, pragmatic solution for smart cities. Unlike all-encompassing metaverses, each microverse instance serves a specific task as a manageable digital twin of an individual network slice. Each microverse enables on-site/near-site data processing, information fusion, and real-time decision-making within the edge–fog–cloud computing framework. The microverse concept is verified using smart public safety surveillance (SPSS) for smart communities as a case study, demonstrating its feasibility in practical smart city applications. The aim is to stimulate discussions and inspire fresh ideas in our community, guiding us as we navigate the evolving digital landscape of smart cities to embrace the potential of the metaverse.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">Springer</abbr> </div> <div id="xu2023ECOMEpoch" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ECOM: Epoch Randomness-Based Consensus Committee Configuration for IoT Blockchains</div> <div class="author"> Ronghua Xu , <em>Deeraj Nagothu</em>, and Yu Chen </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Principles and Practice of Blockchains</em> , Feb 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The rapid advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) networks leads to the proliferation of new smart applications that enable Smart Cities. Since the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, blockchain technology has evolved for extensive applications in various financial services and industrial applications. The increase in research interest from academic and industrial perspectives aims to exploit blockchain technology to enable a decentralized, verifiable, and traceable IoT networks. However, directly integrating cryptocurrency-oriented blockchain technologies into IoT systems faces performance and scalability issues. Splitting the whole blockchain network into multiple independent small-scale consensus networks is promising to overcome performance and scalability problems in heterogeneous IoT networks. In this chapter, following an in-depth review of state-of-the-art solutions for scaling blockchain networks, key design challenges and techniques are identified in terms of epoch randomness generation, network traffic model, and consensus committee configuration. Focusing on scalable and secure random committee selection, this chapter introduces an epoch randomness-enabled consensus committee configuration (ECOM) scheme. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented and evaluated on a physical network that uses Raspberry Pis to simulate IoT devices. The experimental results show that the proposed ECOM protocol efficiently guarantees unpredictable randomness generation and committee selection under a small-scale byzantine network environment.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">SPIE</abbr> </div> <div id="poredi2023AUSOMEAuthenticating" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">AUSOME: authenticating social media images using frequency analysis</div> <div class="author"> Nihal Poredi , Deearj Nagothu , and Yu Chen </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Disruptive Technologies in Information Sciences VII</em> , Jun 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Ever since human society entered the age of social media, every user has had a considerable amount of visual content stored online and shared in variant virtual communities. As an efficient information circulation measure, disastrous consequences are possible if the contents of images are tampered with by malicious actors. Specifically, we are witnessing the rapid development of machine learning (ML) based tools like DeepFake apps. They are capable of exploiting images on social media platforms to mimic a potential victim without their knowledge or consent. These content manipulation attacks can lead to the rapid spread of misinformation that may not only mislead friends or family members but also has the potential to cause chaos in public domains. Therefore, robust image authentication is critical to detect and filter off manipulated images. In this paper, we introduce a system that accurately AUthenticates SOcial MEdia images (AUSOME) uploaded to online platforms leveraging spectral analysis and ML. Images from DALL-E 2 are compared with genuine images from the Stanford image dataset. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) are used to perform a spectral comparison. Additionally, based on the differences in their frequency response, an ML model is proposed to classify social media images as genuine or AI-generated. Using real-world scenarios, the AUSOME system is evaluated on its detection accuracy. The experimental results are encouraging and they verified the potential of the AUSOME scheme in social media image authentications.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">SPIE</abbr> </div> <div id="nagothu2023DEMADecentralized" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">DEMA: decentralized electrical network frequency map for social media authentication</div> <div class="author"> <em>Deeraj Nagothu</em>, Ronghua Xu , and Yu Chen </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Disruptive Technologies in Information Sciences VII</em> , Jun 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The information era has gained a lot of traction due to the abundant digital media contents through technological broadcasting resources. Among the information providers, the social media platform has remained a popular platform for the widespread reach of digital content. Along with accessibility and reach, social media platforms are also a huge venue for spreading misinformation since the data is not curated by trusted authorities. With many malicious participants involved, artificially generated media or strategically altered content could potentially result in affecting the integrity of targeted organizations. Popular content generation tools like DeepFake have allowed perpetrators to create realistic media content by manipulating the targeted subject with a fake identity or actions. Media metadata like time and location-based information are altered to create a false perception of real events. In this work, we propose a Decentralized Electrical Network Frequency (ENF)-based Media Authentication (DEMA) system to verify the metadata information and the digital multimedia integrity. Leveraging the environmental ENF fingerprint captured by digital media recorders, altered media content is detected by exploiting the ENF consistency based on its time and location of recording along with its spatial consistency throughout the captured frames. A decentralized and hierarchical ENF map is created as a reference database for time and location verification. For digital media uploaded to a broadcasting service, the proposed DEMA system correlates the underlying ENF fingerprint with the stored ENF map to authenticate the media metadata. With the media metadata intact, the embedded ENF in the recording is compared with a reference ENF based on the time of recording, and a correlation-based metric is used to evaluate the media authenticity. In case of missing metadata, the frames are divided spatially to compare the ENF consistency throughout the recording.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">ProQuest</abbr> </div> <div id="nagothu2023LightweightMultimedia" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Lightweight Multimedia Authentication at the Edge Using Environmental Fingerprint</div> <div class="author"> <em>Deeraj Nagothu</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> Jun 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> ISBN: 9798380566988 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>With the fast development of Fifth-/Sixth-Generation (5G/6G) communications and the Internet of Video Things (IoVT), a broad range of mega-scale data applications have emerged. The rapid deployment of IoVT devices in modern smart cities has enabled secure infrastructures with minimal human intervention. Accompanied by the proliferation of multimedia is the increasing number of attacks against the IoVT systems. With increased onboard computational resources and technological advances in machine learning (ML) models, attack vectors and detection techniques have evolved to use ML-based techniques more effectively, resulting in non-equilibrium dynamics. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is integrated with many multimedia applications to help enhance its applications. However, the development of General Adversarial Networks (GANs) also led to DeepFake attacks resulting in the misuse of AI. Instead of engaging in an endless AI arms race “fighting fire with fire”, where new Deep Learning (DL) algorithms keep making fake media more realistic and inadvertently causing the spread of misinformation, this dissertation proposes a novel authentication approach leveraging the Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) signals embedded in the multimedia as an environmental fingerprint against visual layer attacks. An ENF operates at a nominal frequency of 60 Hz/50 Hz based on the geographical location and maintains similar fluctuations throughout the power grid. The multimedia recordings can be verified using signal consistency and similarity by leveraging the time-varying nature of the ENF signal collected from both the Audio-Video recordings and simultaneous ground truth ENF. By studying the spectral estimation techniques STFT and MUSIC along with robust frequency enhancement techniques like Weighted Harmonic Combination and Robust Filtering Algorithm (RFA), the optimal ENF estimation workflow for online forgery detection is analyzed and presented. To improve ENF-based authentication performance, frame processing techniques like Selective Superpixel Masking (SSM) to minimize noise from moving subjects and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to minimize false alarms in detection are introduced. Equipped with reliable and robust algorithms, AI-generated media like DeepFake can be detected leveraging the ENF-based authentication system proposed as DeFakePro. Furthermore, the synchronous random fluctuations of ENF throughout the grid are integrated as part of a distributed consensus mechanism for IoVT devices, where the proposed LEFC system can detect faulty nodes with fake media broadcast in the network. Along with online detection capabilities, the DEMA system exploits the media metadata information to verify the source based on the time and location of recording using the reference ENF database from all interconnects. The experimental results show that the proposed systems designed using ENF as the environmental fingerprint can enable effective detection and authentication measures against visual layer attacks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">SPIE</abbr> </div> <div id="chen2023AuthenticationVideo" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Authentication of Video Feeds in Smart Edge Surveillance Networks</div> <div class="author"> <em>Deeraj Nagothu</em>, and Yu Chen </div> <div class="periodical"> Jun 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Large-scale Internet of Video Things (IoVT) based smart edge surveillance systems (SESS) become essential for smart cities because of the increasing demands on situation awareness (SAW).

Authenticating visual/audio feeds becomes the frontier defending the safety and security of residents, properties, and critical infrastructures. To date, due to the gap between the compute-intensive video processing technologies and the resource-constraints in the IoVT environments, there is a compelling need for lightweight, real-time, online video feeds authentication technologies. Starting with the background and fundamentals of IoT and video surveillance, this Spotlight Series book provides an overview of visual layer attacks on SESS and well-known video authentication technologies. Then, following an introduction to the Electric Network Frequency (ENF) signals, this book highlights an ENF-based audio/video authentication technology.

While many new technologies based on Machine Learning (ML) have enabled systems to be utilized for a diverse set of applications, such as license plate detection and car YMM (Year, Make Model) classification, one of the underlying concerns behind VSSs for both public and private sectors is the cost and resource constraints of the devices themselves. Given that optical character recognition and object detection are already computing and data-intensive activities, both in regards to the training of those ML models, as well as the real-time processing of the data, it is highly desired to create or optimize systems to operate on lightweight Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight scheme for Decentralized Vehicular Identification (DEVID), which is affordable to inexpensive IoT devices as long as they are capable of managing their inputs and outputs (IO) in a fashion that is not costly in terms of storage or power consumption. While the performance in the experimental study is not satisfactory, the DEVID system possesses the potential to be a cost-friendly lightweight solution for smart cities.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">IEEE-NAECON</abbr> </div> <div id="nagothu2023ApplicationElectrical" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Application of Electrical Network Frequency as an Entropy Generator in Distributed Systems</div> <div class="author"> <em>Deeraj Nagothu</em>, Ronghua Xu , Yu Chen , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

As the number of devices in the ecosystem exponentially increases, the power grid infrastructure has continued to function as the backbone of smart cities and support the growing requirements for electricity, such as multimedia services. Media authentication technology leveraging the power system frequency, the Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) signal, has gained traction as an environmental fingerprint to counteract visual layer attacks targeted toward multimedia-based edge devices. Due to the unique and similar fluctuation patterns throughout the grid, the ENF signal is reliable in applications like multimedia synchronization, authentication, and source identification. ENF -based systems are inevitably targeted by perpetrators to bypass their detection schemes; however, such attacks are successful only if the ENF fingerprint can be pre-dicted. In this work, we studied the randomization nature of ENF signals and the societal impacts on its fluctuation patterns due to power grid consumption. Leveraging the ENF signal fluctuations, we integrate ENF as a source of randomness for the Random Bit Generator (RBG) system in cryptographic applications. An RBG-based encrypted communication and committee election mechanism is proposed for an enhanced distribution multimedia system.

A Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) approach was selected to minimize the false positive rate of signal correlations. Extensive experimental analysis for a reliable ENF edge-based estimation in deepfaked multimedia recordings is provided to facilitate the need for distinguishing artificially altered media content.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">SPIE</abbr> </div> <div id="nagothu2022DistributedCrawler" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Distributed Crawler for IoVT-based Public Safety Surveillance Exploring the Spatio-Temporal Correlation</div> <div class="author"> <em>Deeraj Nagothu</em>, Daniel Dimock , Adrian Kulesza , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

In today’s networked surveillance environment, however, human operators are often overwhelmed with the huge amount of visual feeds, which causes poor judgment and delayed response to emergencies. This paper proposes a distributed crawler scheme (DiCrawler) for smart surveillance systems deployed on Internet of Video Things (IoVT). The IoVT camera nodes monitor continuous video input, track the object of interest while preserving privacy, and relay correlative information to targeted nodes for constant monitoring. Each IoVT node monitors the space inside its field of view (FoV) and notifies the neighboring nodes about the objects leaving the FoV and heading in their directions. A smart communication algorithm among IoVT nodes is designed to prevent network bandwidth bottlenecks and preserve computational power. The DiCrawler system can corroborate with human operators and assist with decision-making by raising alarms in case of suspicious behavior. The IoVT network is completely decentralized, using only peer-to-peer (P2P) communication. DiCrawler does not rely on a central server for any computations, preventing a potential bottleneck if hundreds of cameras were connected and constantly uploading data to a server. Each module is also in a compact form factor, making it viable to be mounted on traditional security surveillance cameras. Extensive experimental study on a proof-of-concept prototype validated the effectiveness of the DiCrawler design.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">IntechOpen</abbr> </div> <div id="nagothu2022EvolutionAttacks" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Evolution of Attacks on Intelligent Surveillance Systems and Effective Detection Techniques</div> <div class="author"> <em>Deeraj Nagothu</em>, Nihal Poredi , Yu Chen , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

As part of the critical infrastructure, surveillance systems are often targeted by attackers aiming to compromise the security and safety of smart cities. Manipulating the audio or video channels could create a false perception of captured events and bypass detection. This chapter presents an overview of the attack vectors designed to compromise intelligent surveillance systems and discusses existing detection techniques. With advanced machine learning (ML) models and computing resources, both attack vectors and detection techniques have evolved to use ML-based techniques more effectively, resulting in non-equilibrium dynamics. The current detection techniques vary from training a neural network to detect forgery artifacts to use the intrinsic and extrinsic environmental fingerprints for any manipulations. Therefore, studying the effectiveness of different detection techniques and their reliability against the defined attack vectors is a priority to secure the system and create a plan of action against potential threats.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">SPIE</abbr> </div> <div id="quan2021CriPIEfficient" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">CriPI: An Efficient Critical Pixels Identification Algorithm for Fast One-Pixel Attacks</div> <div class="author"> Wei Quan , <em>Deeraj Nagothu</em>, Nihal Poredi , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

However, there are also concerns about the security problems and vulnerabilities of DNN. Studies on adversarial network development have shown that relatively more minor perturbations can impact the DNN performance and manipulate its outcome. The impacts of adversarial perturbations have led to the development of advanced techniques for generating image-level perturbations. Once embedded in a clean image, these perturbations are not perceptible to human eyes and fool a well-trained deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier. This work introduces a new Critical-Pixel Iterative (CriPI) algorithm after a thorough study on critical pixels’ characteristics. The proposed CriPI algorithm can identify the critical pixels and generate one-pixel attack perturbations with a much higher efficiency.

It is very challenging to timely authenticate each video stream from pervasively deployed IoVT devices. This article presents a Blockchain Enhanced Video input Authentication (BEVA) scheme as an edge service to fight against the visual layer attacks on smart IoVT systems such as online false video injection and offline video streams tampering attacks.

By leveraging Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) signals extracted from multimedia recordings as region-of-recording proofs, this paper proposes EconLedger, an ENF-based consensus mechanism that enables secure and lightweight distributed ledgers for small-scale IoVT edge networks.

The decentralized database (DDB) is adopted in order to guarantee efficiency and resilience of raw ENF proofs on the off-chain storage.

The more oversight UAVs require, the less likely they are going to be commercially advantageous when compared to their alternatives. As an autonomous system, how much human interaction is needed to function is one of the best indicators evaluating the limitations and inefficiencies of the UAVs. Popular UAV related research areas, such as path planning and computer vision, have enabled substantial advances in the ability of drones to act on their own. This research is dedicated to in-flight operations, in which there is not much reported effort to tackle the problem from the aspect of the supportive infrastructure. In this paper, an Autonomous Service network infrastructure (AutoServe) is proposed. Aiming at increasing the future autonomy of UAVs, the AutoServe system includes a service-oriented landing platform and a customized communication protocol. This supportive AutoServe infrastructure will autonomize many tasks currently done manually by human operators, such as battery replacement.

While SPS facilitates convenient exchanges of surveillance data streams among device owners and third-party applications, the existing monolithic service-oriented architecture (SOA) is unable to provide scalable and extensible services in a large-scale heterogeneous network environment. Moreover, traditional security solutions rely on a centralized trusted third-party authority, which not only can be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure, but it also incurs privacy concerns on improperly use of private information.

Nowadays, a prohibitively large amount of surveillance data is being generated continuously by ubiquitously distributed video sensors. It is very challenging to immediately identify the objects of interest or zoom in suspicious actions from thousands of video frames. Making the big data indexable is critical to tackle this problem. It is ideal to generate pattern indexes in a real-Time, on-site manner on the video streaming instead of depending on the batch processing at the cloud centers. The modern edge-fog-cloud computing paradigm allows implementation of time sensitive tasks at the edge of the network. The on-site edge devices collect the information sensed in format of frames and extracts useful features. The near-site fog nodes conduct the contextualization and classification of the features. The remote cloud center is in charge of more data intensive and computing intensive tasks. However, exchanging the index information among devices in different layers raises security concerns where an adversary can capture or tamper with features to mislead the surveillance system. In this paper, a blockchain enabled scheme is proposed to protect the index data through an encrypted secure channel between the edge and fog nodes. It reduces the chance of attacks on the small edge and fog devices.

Accompanied by the proliferation of video is the increasing number of attacks against surveillance systems. Among the attacks, False Frame Injection (FFI) attacks that replay video frames from a previous recording to mask the live feed has the highest impact. While many attempts have been made to detect FFI frames using features from the video feeds, video analysis is computationally too intensive to be deployed on-site for real-time false frame detection. In this paper, we investigated the feasibility of FFI attacks on compromised surveillance systems at the edge and propose an effective technique to detect the injected false video and audio frames by monitoring the surveillance feed using the embedded Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) signals. An ENF operates at a nominal frequency of 60 Hz/50 Hz based on its geographical location and maintains a stable value across the entire power grid interconnection with minor fluctuations. For surveillance system video/audio recordings connected to the power grid, the ENF signals are embedded. The time-varying nature of the ENF component was used as a forensic application for authenticating the surveillance feed. The paper highlights the ENF signal collection from a power grid creating a reference database and ENF extraction from the recordings using conventional short-time Fourier Transform and spectrum detection for robust ENF signal analysis in the presence of noise and interference caused in different harmonics. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of ENF signal detection and/or abnormalities for FFI attacks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">IEEE-ISC2</abbr> </div> <div id="nagothu2019MicroserviceenabledArchitecture" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Microservice-Enabled Architecture for Smart Surveillance Using Blockchain Technology</div> <div class="author"> <em>Deeraj Nagothu</em>, Ronghua Xu , Seyed Y.

Compared to the traditional surveillance systems that is built following a monolithic architecture to carry out lower level operations, such as monitoring and recording, the modern surveillance systems are expected to support more scalable and decentralized solutions for advanced video stream analysis at the large volumes of distributed edge devices. In addition, the centralized architecture of the conventional surveillance systems is vulnerable to single point of failure and privacy breach owning to the lack of protection to the surveillance feed. This position paper introduces a novel secure smart surveillance system based on microservices architecture and blockchain technology. Encapsulating the video analysis algorithms as various independent microservices not only isolates the video feed from different sectors, but also improve the system availability and robustness by decentralizing the operations. The blockchain technology securely synchronizes the video analysis databases among microservices across surveillance domains, and provides tamper proof of data in the trustless network environment. Smart contract enabled access authorization strategy prevents any unauthorized user from accessing the microservices and offers a scalable, decentralized and fine-grained access control solution for smart surveillance systems.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">SPIE</abbr> </div> <div id="nagothu2019StudySmart" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Study on Smart Online Frame Forging Attacks against Video Surveillance System</div> <div class="author"> <em>Deeraj Nagothu</em>, Jacob Schwell , Yu Chen , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

A VSS is normally deployed in a secure network to prevent the access from unauthorized personnel. Compared to traditional systems that continuously record video regardless of the actions in the frame, a smart VSS has the capability of capturing video data upon motion detection or object detection, and then extracts essential information and send to users. This increasing design complexity of the surveillance system, however, also introduces new security vulnerabilities. In this work, a smart, real-time frame duplication attack is investigated. We show the feasibility of forging the video streams in real-time as the camera’s surroundings change. The generated frames are compared constantly and instantly to identify changes in the pixel values that could represent motion detection or changes in light intensities outdoors. An attacker (intruder) can remotely trigger the replay of some previously duplicated video streams manually or automatically, via a special quick response (QR) code or when the face of an intruder appear in the camera field of view. A detection technique is proposed by leveraging the real-time electrical network frequency (ENF) reference database to match with the power grid frequency.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">LNCS</abbr> </div> <div id="nagothu2017ICrawlVisual" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">iCrawl: A Visual High Interaction Web Crawler</div> <div class="author"> <em>Deeraj Nagothu</em>, and Andrey Dolgikh </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Lect.
